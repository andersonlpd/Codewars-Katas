## String incrementer

Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.<br>
<br>
    If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.<br>
    If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.<br>

## Examples:

foo -> foo1<br>

foobar23 -> foobar24<br>

foo0042 -> foo0043<br>

foo9 -> foo10<br>

foo099 -> foo100<br>
<br>
Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.
